# Joey's Chess

This project aims to run chess using Python.
As of now the game mechanics are complete

Future updates will include:

Improving the UI
Adding sound, timers and a graphic to display which pieces have been captured
A menu with an option to play against an engine of my own design
Cleaning up main.py as it is a mess

To play the game run main.py and it will start automatically
